# Family Financials Application

## Description
A long term investment app built for families and for each of the families to pool their money together and to invest together.  This will help families realize the benefit of long term investment, especially for those of younger age.  

## User Story
As an user and a parent, I'd like to use an investment app that would allow me to add my family members, spouse and children (or grandparents), to an account where we are able to pool all of our money together to purchase stocks/ETFs/Mutual funds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application is deployed to a public cloud so anyone can get to it.
- As a new user to the application, the user is able to create a new user account.
- As an user logs in to the application, the password must not be visible and shall be hashed. 
- Once an user logs in, the application should give the user the ability to add any family members, to logout, and to buy stock(s).
- If the user's account already owns stock(s), as the user logs in, the dashboard should provide the user a pie-chart that shows all of the stocks in the account.
- The pie-chart on the dashboard should be color-coded and has labels and hover-over effect to give the user a snapshot of what's in the account and who owns what and how much.
-  The user should have the ability to choose what stock(s) he/she wants to purchase and how many shares and for which family member.
- The user should have the ability to sell the stock(s) for any listed family members of the account.
- When an user logs out, the user is taken to the home page where the user can login again.
